 2. Model Data
  * Application logic does not drive data schema
  * Look for real-world objects of interest
  * Usual stuff
   * deduplicate
   * drop unnecssary (in consultation)
  * Stripping out organisational knowledge
  * Think about how data may evolve over time
  * Remember things that change over time
