# The Scribe's Oath
## Robert C. Martin

* Scribes were the purveyors of information and thus the rulers of the world
 * Exempt from taxes
 * Exempt from military service
* Rules
 * Pages must be <48<60 lines
  * When writing "Javeh" they must wash themselves and thei rpen before + after
  * Text must be reviewd (within 30 days)
  * Checksums: line count, word count etc
* History
  * Programmers
    * Lovelace
      * Noticed that computers manipulate symbols, not numbers
    * Turing ~1947
      * Closer to what we recognise as code
  * Growth
   * into the 60's #programmers went from 1 -> 00000's
  * But nobody knew who they were or what they did
 * 70's
  * microcopmuters
  * operating systems
  * ~1 million programmers (from 1 in 1948)
   * people knew who they were
   * depicted as geeks (coffee commerical
 * 80's
  * Evil geniuses (Jurassic Park)
 * 90's and beyond
  * Rate of programmers doubling every 2 years
  * Average experience is 5 years
  * Why thre seems to be a lack of old people - there weren't many to begin with 
 * Now
  * Programmers have become heros to children
  * Something to aspire to
  * The modern-day scribes
* The modern-day scribes
 * A language people needs, but few want
 * THe language of civilizaiton
 * Without software
  * No law is made
  * No purchase is made
  * No phone calls
  * No microwaves
  * No cars
  * No lights!?
  * Cars
   * Accelerator + Brake is computerised
   * People have died because of this
 * Society depends on us
  * In a way it doesn't understand yet
  * And we don't understand yet
* Potential for heavy regulation
 * If somebody does something bad and lots of people
 * Example of VW: "some programmer did it..."
 * "My boss wanted it by Friday" won't wash
* Guidelines
 1. I will not write hardmful code
  * This includes bad code which does harm to devs around you
  * Society at large think we have already made this choice
 2. The code that I produce will always be my best work 
  * Do not allow it to *accumulate*
  * Anyone who didn't raise hands is lying
  * Employers etc already assume this (regardless of timeframes)
 3. I will producea repeatable prood that... the code works as it should.
  * Unacceptable to release code you don't know *works*
 4. I will make frequent, small releases so that I do not impede... others
 5. I will improve our work at every opportunity... never allow it to degrade
  * Humans make things better with time
  * If you make things worse with time you are no better than thermal energy... entropy
 6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others as high as possiible
 7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me and I can cover for them
  * As in sports
  * A team is a group of peole who can cover for each other
 8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty
  * Estimates are necessary
  * Ranges that are within 95-97% probable
 9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft
  * The worst thing you can do is learn a lang/framework and ride the curve down... it's not pretty down there.
