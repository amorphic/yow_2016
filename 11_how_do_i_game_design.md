* Why d we play games?
 * Fun
 * But what is fun?
* Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics
 * Games differnt from other media
  * Choice 
   * Chase
   * Chess
   * Jump Rope
 * Definition
  * Something you Play defined by Rules
 * Mechanics
  * Descriptions of how things move
 * Dynamics
  * How players interact w/mechanics
 * Mechanics and Dynamics closely related
  * Dynamics happen because humans act within the mechanics
 * Dynamics are related to behaviour but they are not the same
 * Dynamics are related to strategy but they are not the same
 * Emergence
  * Not in the rules but present anyway
  * Things that happen during the course of the game that affect behaviour
 * Aesthetics
  * Dynamics play out and have effects on players
  * E.g. "chase": implicit feeling of threat/fear... even though we know it's not real
  * 8 kinds of fun
 * PoV
  * Designer:
   * Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics
  * Player:
   * Aesthetics -> Dynamics -> Mechanics
  * So Designer has to begin with the Aesthetics and work back
* Small changes in mechanics = big changes in dynamics + aesthetics
 * The Resistance
* Narrative
 * Pre-written narrative
  * Graphics, sound, setting etc
 * Emergent narrative
  * Reinforcement thru dynamics
  * E.g. Ravenholm in HL2
   * Player deliberately starveed of ammo
   * VS earlier areas with *lots* of ammo
   * Sudden contrast creates unease
   * Player forced to improvise and get closer
   * New dynamics to reinforce this
    * Poisoned headcrabs only ever drop your health to 1
    * All other enemies suddenly become more deadly
    * Player has to suddenly improvise, change narrative
  * Games are the only medium with this
* Dramatic Tension
 * Uncertainty
  * Fog of War
  * MK boxes
 * Inevitability
  * Space Invaders - they're coming... 
  * MK race - it will end soon
 * Outcome unknown - anyone can win or lose
* Game DEsign for Not-Games
 * Why?
  * Games are Engaging! Get people's attentin and encourage them to come back...
  * Not gamification (simply adding achievements/points - not quite what we're after)
   * Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics
 * User Stories
  * Mechanical implementation and Aesthetics Produced
 * Desire Paths
  * Underhand how people are interacting with existing mechanics
  * What aesthetics are beign produced
  * How can we then change the mechanics?
  * E.g. RT: originally a hack around existing mechanics
   * Created as a better mechanic
   * Gave birth to "popularity" in twitter
   * Gave birth to "Weird Twitter"
   * Gave birth to new services ("Favstar")
 * Mechanics don't directly lead to outcomes
  * You can't create "fun"

Note: "The Resistance" card game
