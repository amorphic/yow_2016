# The Rationale for Continuous Delivery
## Dave Farley

* Cycle Times
 * Measurement of SD process
 * Traditionally days
  * (10-103!)
 * Now minutes
  * Limited scope
  * Easy to remember what's changed
 * Optimising cycle time
  * Drivess all of the new practices
   * Agile
   * DevOps
   * CD
* What is CD
 * First principle of the agile manifesto
 * The logical estension of CI
 * Holistic approach to dev
 * Ever commit creates an RC
 * Finished means _in the hands of users_
* Principles of CD
 * Repeatable, reliable process for releases
 * Automate everything
 * Everything in version control
 * If it hurts do it more often - bring the pain forward
 * Build quality in
 * Done means *released*
 * Everybody is responsible for the release process
 * Improve continuously
* Pushbacks
 * We can't release that fast!
  * Amazon
   * push to prod ever 11.6 sec
   * 10k hosts
